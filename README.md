##### Semi-producton grade version of Cigar2 

Features added:

* Webpack intregration (mostly for bundling and obfuscating) 
* 90% finished replay recorder
* Refactor of the original cigar2 to make it more modular

The idea was to rewrite cigar2 to make it production grade. This entailed refactoring the entire codebase by seperating out the major compondents into their own respective files for better organization and readability. Webpack support was added, and adding features such as the Replay feature. 

I may come back to this project in the future.
