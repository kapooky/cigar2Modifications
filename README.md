# Hi Takis, 
If you would like to commit something, please feel free to do so in the masterbranch 

If you are working on a feature, or maybe just playing around and don't want to pollute the masterbranch, you can fork the masterbranch and rename it as a feature 
branch. see this for more information:

take care
