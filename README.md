# Hi Takis, 
If you would like to commit something, please feel free to do so in the masterbranch 

If you are working on a feature, or maybe just playing around and don't want to pollute the masterbranch, you can fork the masterbranch and rename it as a feature 
branch. see this for more information:

take care

Within this repository, you will find 3 branches:
1. the replayer branch 
2. the replay branch
3. the masterbranch 

### The Replayer Branch 
This branch contains code that allows the client to record 10 seconds of gameplay. Once a user clicks the 'r' key, the client immediately outputs a textfile of server instructions. 

### The Replay Branch 
Once you have the textfile from the Replayer branch, you feed it into this branch to see realtime playback of your game. 

**Both of these branches are work in progress, but you are free to try to them out** 

### The MasterBranch 

self-explanatory
